# Course registration for grad students

**Time Tickets**

Each student gets assigned a specific time slot during which they can register for courses. Students can add or drop classes only during the time assigned to them on their time tickets.

How to view your time ticket:

1. Log in to buzzport
2. On the Registration &amp; Student services tab, select &#39;Registration (OSCAR)&#39;
3. You will be directed to the &#39;Student Services &amp; Financial Aid&#39; page
4. Select &#39;Registration&#39;
5. Select &#39;Term&#39; and a desired term from the drop down menu
6. Select &#39;Registration Status&#39; to view your time ticket

_Note: Time Tickets for Phase I registration are usually assigned the Friday before academic advisement for the next term._

_Time Tickets for Phase II registration are usually assigned the Friday following grade processing for the previous term. Refer to the Academic Calendar for specific dates._

**Registering for courses**

1. Follow the same procedure as for viewing the Time Ticket, but for Step 6, Select &#39;Add or Drop Classes&#39;.
2. Classes can be added by entering the Course Reference Number (CRN) in the &quot;Add Class&quot; table.
3. The list of available courses can be viewed by pressing the _Class Search_ button. To register, click the box next to the desired course. If the course is closed (no more available seats) a &quot;C&quot; will appear to the left of the CRN instead of a box. After selecting the course, select add to worksheet and submit for registration.
4. If registration was successful, those classes will appear in the &quot;Class Registered Successfully&quot; section
5. Classes can be dropped by using the pull down box next to the course.
6. If Registration was unsuccessful, a registration error message marked with a stop sign will appear. For information on how to resolve registration errors, view: [https://registrar.gatech.edu/registration/error-messages](https://registrar.gatech.edu/registration/error-messages)

**Compulsory courses for CBS students**

Students must register for the following courses every semester:

1. Psych 6040: Topics in Cognition and Brain Sciences (1 credit)
  - This is a weekly seminar (Brownbag) where students and faculty from CBS can present their work
2. Psych 8907: Special Problems in Cognition and Brain Sciences
  - Make sure to register under the section &#39;DR&#39;
  - This is a restricted course, so permits will have to be obtained prior to registration (see below)
  - Sign up for as many credits as you need to reach the maximum number of credits you are allowed to register for (21 for Fall/Spring and 16 for Summer Terms). * If you're an international student, you should register at least 12 credit hours to be considered as a full-time student.
  - To change the number of credits, once you have successfully registered for the course, click on the number of credits assigned to the class in the &quot;Class Registered Successfully&quot; section and enter the number of credits you wish to register.
