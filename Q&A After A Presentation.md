# Q&A After A Presentation 

You’ve just finished presenting on your research to a room (or virtual room) full of senior academics and peers. You’re tired, relieved, and you feel like your job is done. But then, the dreaded question and answer period. Someone asks you a question you didn’t hear, didn’t understand, or simply don’t want to answer. What do you do?

We’ve all been there. Asking and answering questions about research in an academic setting is a skill that they don’t explicitly teach you during your undergrad or in grad school. You have to learn that through trial and, embarrassingly, error.

Below are some tips and links to articles that you may find helpful:
1)	**Prepare.** The number 1 thing you can do in this situation is prepare. While you are practicing your presentation, identify questions that an audience member is likely to ask. Find any weak points that may need to defend/clarify and come up with ways to explain, defend, or admit fault ahead of time. If you are unable to come up with answers by yourself, discuss these questions with Doby and you can tackle them together.
2)	**Know your subfield.** Read deeply, and get very familiar with the literature on your research topic. If someone asks a question that you don’t feel your research can answer directly, you can still respond by discussing how their question links to other work in the literature, and how your research is connected to, or different from what’s out there. 
3)	**Practice with your lab.** We are all in this together, and dry runs of your presentation allow lab mates to not only give feedback on the content of your presentation but also help you identify questions that will likely be asked. 
4)	**Actively participate in journal clubs.** This is an indirect way to develop the skill. It incorporates both points 1 and 2 because you can practice asking and answering questions as you discuss an empirical paper in a safe space (your lab), and you are also learning more about relevant literature. 
5)	**Read Q & A tip articles.**  We include a few here that may be helpful, but you can also do your own search to find tips that resonate with you.
