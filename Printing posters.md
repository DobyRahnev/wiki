# Printing posters

You can print your posters at the library in the Multimedia Computing area (3rd floor). Step-by-step, written instructions on how to print a poster will be available at the site. Otherwise, you can submit a printing request ([https://www.library.gatech.edu/poster-request](https://www.library.gatech.edu/poster-request)) and pick it up at the library.

The posters can be printed 24-, 36-, and 42-inches in width and can be of any length.

To make a payment, you can use Buzzfund (by depositing money to your Buzzcard; [https://buzzcard.gatech.edu/](https://buzzcard.gatech.edu/)) and then get reimbursed from the department (see [Reimbursement page](https://github.com/RahnevLab/wiki/blob/master/Reimbursement.pdf)). If you are submitting an online request in advance, you can ask the department to cover the cost directly (you would need to provide funding number).
