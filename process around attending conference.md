Process around attending conferences

Before conference

All the expenses related to attending conference (including but not limited to registration fee, membership fee, poster fee, airfare, lodging, meals, etc.) will be compensated via funding resources in Georgia Tech. Basically, there are four funding resources which you need to apply to before you are eligible to receive the compensation. 

The first funding resource is Student Government Association (SGA). A maximum award of $250 will be allowed for you to present in a conference each fiscal year (July 1st to June 30th). The applications are due 21 days prior to departure date for travel. They are very strict about this deadline. So, try to book this deadline in your calendar to ensure that you don’t miss it. The instructions related to application procedure can be found in the following link:

The second source of funding comes from College of Sciences (CoS). A maximum award of $250 will be allowed for you to present in a conference each fiscal year (July 1st to June 30th). There is no hard deadline for this funding. You simply need to email Ashley Edwards (ashley.edwards@cos.gatech.edu) and provide the information about the conference (when and where the conference is taking place, and your intention to attend the conference). You should receive a confirmation email saying that you are eligible for this fund. And that’s it.

The third funding resource comes from school of psychology. A maximum award of $250 will be allowed for you to present in a conference each fiscal year (July 1st to June 30th). Once you are done with previous two steps, you have to send an email to Kaysha Chandler (kaysha.corniffe@psych.gatech.edu), financial administrator of the department, letting her know that you are going to attend a conference. She is going to give you instructions regarding application details for this funding. Basically, you have to create an “spend authorization” on Workday system (https://wd5.myworkday.com/gatech) and provide all the receipts you already have and expected expenses for your conference. 

The final source of funding is the grant money that we have in lab. This funding is not limited to any amount, but the goal is to prioritize other funding resources rather than using it. There is no deadline for this funding. You do not need to report anything before the conference. All you need is your advisor’s confirmation. However, you’ll need to go through all the steps mentioned above when applying for department funding.

After conference
Once you’re back from conference, you have 21 days to submit an “expense report” on Workday system. In this step, you’ll have to report all the expenses you made related to the conference. Note that, you will need a receipt for all of the expenses you paid (including registration fee, membership fee, poster fee, hotel, etc.) except for food. 

Once you submit the expense report, you are done with the process. Don’t forget to track changes your Workday account because sometimes your request for compensation gets rejected at one stage and they never send you email regarding the problem.
