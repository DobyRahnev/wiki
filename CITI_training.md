# CITI training
Before you can be added to the lab’s IRB and run subjects, you need to complete several “Collaborative Institutional Training Initiative” (CITI) trainings. You can complete these online. They do take a fair amount of time, so plan accordingly. By the way, the CITI website changes fairly often, so these instructions regularly need updating. If you realize that the link above doesn’t work on the options have changed, email Kai (kxue33@gatech.edu) about where you got stuck and she will help you. 

Here are detailed instructions on how to access these training (for similar instructions, see: https://researchintegrity.gatech.edu/forms/IRB/CITI_for_GT_users_slides_03_2020.pdf):
1.	Go to https://www.citiprogram.org/?pageID=668 and click on “Georgia Institute of Technology”. Then, sign in with your Georgia Tech account.
2.	Click on “Courses” at the very top of the page and then select “Add a Course” under “Learner Tools for Georgia Institute of Technology”
3.	Under “Select Curriculum Below”, check both the “Human Subjects Research” and “Responsible Conduct of Research” boxes.
4.	Then, under learner group, check only the “Group 1: Biomedical research Investigators and Key Personnel”
5.	On the third and fourth page, check “N/A” button for GCP and HIPS selection.
6.	Now you must complete the two courses. This does not have to be done in one setting. You may complete it at your own pace.

Starting in Fall 2021, you also have to complete CITI training specific to the Navy (though the training is extremely similar). The instructions on how to complete the Navy-related training is available at the IRB website (https://researchintegrity.gatech.edu/). Once you have completed all of the Navy trainings, email Kai to confirm that you have done so and attach the certificates from the Navy training (no need to attach the certificates from the GT-related training).
