## List of meetings in the lab (As of Oct. 22nd, 2020)

**1. Lab meetings**

The lab meeting is held on every Friday, 10 â€“ 11a.m. At the beginning of each semester, all lab members discuss and decide the topics for the lab meetings for that semester. The meeting schedule for Fall 2020 can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1J75YIgvYJZZxkUU6rwoW8nxVYu6J167SPATdbHHvJUg/edit#gid=0).

Lab meetings will include the following formats:

- Journal club: Read a research article that is relevant to the lab and discuss
- Guest speaker: Invite a guest speaker to the lab meeting to present their research
- Knowledge sharing: One of the lab members gives a short presentation for sharing technical skills or specific knowledge that are relevant to doing research
- Code review: One of the lab members shares their codes and the lab discusses how to improve coding skills

**2. Lab briefings**

Lab briefing is held on every Friday, at 11 a.m., after the lab meeting. It is a short, 15-30 min meeting, where every lab member talks what they have done during the week for their research and what their aims are for the next week. Before coming to the meeting, all lab members should write their goals for the next week in the lab briefing spread sheet ([here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Kw2Sj8zTnOsQdgkk2nXg2FaNAsW3YuPHrn0Wiaa9ASM/edit#gid=1580450592)). Each lab member has their own row, and a new column should be created next to the column for the names for entering new input. Work that has been done should be colored in green (a specific green color in the &#39;custom&#39; section among the font colors), while things not completed should be colored in red.

**3. Individual regular meetings**

Each lab member has a regular individual meeting with Doby. Different lab members have different frequencies of meeting, which is decided between Doby and themselves. Junior members usually have more frequent meetings (e.g., once every other week), while senior members usually have the meeting less frequently (e.g., once a month). During this meeting, you can discuss anything related to your research, career, or concerns. Each lab member is expected to lead the discussion for their meeting.

**4. Meetings for individual research**

There is no regular meeting for research projects. Email Doby to set up a meeting for discussing your projects whenever necessary.
