We mostly use SPM for our data analysis purposes; consequently, this leads us to use the tools incorporated in this package for visualization proposes. However, since a great visualization is a key component for a research article or a presentation, we try other packages which provide a better visualization for our specific purpose. One popular SPM-based package is bspmview (https://www.bobspunt.com/software/bspmview). This package is very easy to use and provide a convenient graphical user interface (GUI) for 3D and 2D visualization of statistical neuroimages. 

Furthermore, depending on the purpose of the study, CONN toolbox and Nilearn provide a great visualization of results, especially when dealing with connectivity or multivariate type of analysis. CONN toolbox is mostly based on GUI, while Nilearn is mostly based on the scripting and programming. Therefore, Nilearn will give you more flexibility for creating great brain activation figures.
