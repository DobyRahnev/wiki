# Rahnev lab guide for writing papers

## Stages of preparation of the paper
The below are suggested steps but they will likely apply to most papers. Send your work to Doby after completing each step to make sure that you’re on the same page.
1.	(At the start of a project) Write the expected title, authors, and abstract. Write these assuming that everything in the project will go as you plan it. This will feel a bit awkward because you don’t have any data yet! However, it is really helpful to imagine what the final product will look like in the best-case scenario (e.g., if this doesn’t seem exciting, then the project may not be that good). It can also serve later as a high-level guidance for the analysis process.
2.	(At the end of the project) Prepare all figures. Once we have agreed on the figures, this is the sign that the rest of the writing should begin.
3.	Update the title, authors, and abstract. Complete the cover page with all remaining information (author affiliations, keywords, author contributions, acknowledgements for grants and help with the project).
4.	Write detailed outlines for the different sections. For the Introduction and Discussion, include one bullet point per paragraph. For the Methods and Results, you can just include the relevant subsections. Make references to the figures in these outlines. 
5.	Write the body of the paper!

## The nitty-gritty stuff
**General formatting**

o	Use double-spacing throughout, except for figure legends which should be single spaced

o	Insert page numbers in the center of the page

o	Use Bold for 1st level headings, Underline for 2nd level headings, and Italicized for 3rd level headings (organize the paper to avoid 4th level headings; most papers should be organized with just two levels of headings)

o	Insert page breaks before each new section (Abstract, Methods, Results, Discussion, References)

o	Make sure that all formatting is consistent across the paper. For example, the whole document should have the same font, font size, text alignment, etc.

**Figures**

o	Only insert figures of small size into the document. Figures should be either in eps format (if directly saved from Matlab) or a whole slide should be copied from PowerPoint. Do not insert jpeg figures unless it cannot be helped for some reason. The total file size should be less than 2 Mb. If you have trouble making the file size small, you can use the following website to compress the file without decreasing the figure quality: https://www.wecompress.com/en/

o	When inserting figures, just drag and drop them into Word. Do not change the formatting like centering the figure or changing the “wrap text” features 

**References**

o	Insert references using a reference manager such as Mendeley. Do not insert references manually.

o	Use APA style for references while writing the paper. If the first name or initials appears for any of the citations in the text, it’s likely because the author name appears differently in different references inside Mendeley (e.g., D. Rahnev vs. Dobromir Rahnev). If this is the case, edit the author names directly in the citation manager (e.g., Mendeley) using the author’s full name (e.g., Dobromir Rahnev) for all citations.

**Stats**

o	Always report exact p values unless you are referring to several p values at the same time, in which case write something like “all p’s < .01”. If a p value is less than .0001, report it in the following format: “p = 2.3 * 10-5”. 

o	Avoid overprecision when reporting stats. For example, “t(22) = 0.3452, p = 0.3625” is excessive. Instead, write “t(11) = 0.35, p = 0.36”. In general, it rarely makes sense to report more than 2 digits after the decimal sign. When reporting RT in ms, it rarely makes sense to report even a single digit after the decimal sign (e.g., use whole numbers instead)

**Editing**

o	Before sending a version of the paper to Doby, check the writing using Grammarly. (You may want to try this software for other pieces of writing too.) You do not need to accept all changes proposed by Grammarly (it also deals poorly with equations) but it will help you catch a lot of errors and issues in the writing.

o	Name the first version of the file “MS_v1”. After editing, I’ll return “MS_v1_DR”. For the next version, send back “MS_v2”, etc. If we’re submitting to a different journal, reset the numbering system back to v1.

o	When you receive edits from Doby, you should generally accept them and make additional changes with tracked changes. This allows Doby to see what changed since the previous version. If you forgot to do this, you can use the “Compare documents” feature in Word to generate the tracked changes after the fact but that feature doesn’t work perfectly and should not be used as the primary option. When substituting figures, the previous version of the figure doesn’t have to appear as a tracked change.


## Guidelines for writing the paper
**There are a lot of rules for making writing good. You should strive to continuously improve your writing as it will be critical for the rest of your career, regardless of whether you stay in academia or not.**

•	Read carefully and follow the directions in the paper “Ten simple rules for structuring papers” by Mensh and Kording (2017).

•	Your paper as a whole but also each section and sub-section should have a story to them. The reader needs to know what the story is. It needs to be clear and easy to follow. If there’s no story, the words will be forgotten within minutes.

•	Write in the most simple and direct language you can. Don’t worry, nobody will think your paper is simplistic. Instead, they’ll be ecstatic that they can actually understand what you’re saying. The paper should be written such that a non-specialist can relatively easily follow most of it (think your friend from a different discipline). If a non-specialist needs something explained in more detail, you probably need to explain that in more detail.

•	Use short paragraphs.

•	Make a single point per paragraph.

•	Use short sentences.

•	Use active voice.

•	Avoid acronyms as much as possible.

•	Avoid nonspecific terms, such as “relate to”, “affect”, “influence”, and “change”. Use specific terms such as “increase”, “decrease”, “improve”, “worsen”, “augment”, “diminish”, “strengthen”, “weaken”, “cause”, etc.

•	Avoid using “this” as a subject. For example, the sentence “This implies X” leaves it unclear what exactly is the “this” that is being referred to. Usually, adding a noun fixes the ambiguity: “This finding implies X”.

•	Don’t start sentences with “Interestingly” or similar words. What is interesting is subjective. Instead, explain how what you’re about to say relates to your main narrative.

•	Check out the table below for some additional advice:
